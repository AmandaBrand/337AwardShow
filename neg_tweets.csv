|negative|,|worst dressed actresses at award functions URL |
|negative|,|no wonder he got worst dressed award.. he wears robes everyday |
|negative|,|simplistic , silly and tedious .|
|negative|,|it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .|
|negative|,|exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .|
|negative|,|he discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .|
|negative|,|a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .|
|negative|,|the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .|
|negative|,|about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time|
|negative|,|not so much farcical as sour .|
|negative|,|unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .|
|negative|,|all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .|
|negative|,|a sentimental mess that never rings true .|
|negative|,|while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary|
|negative|,|but not compelling .|
|negative|,|on a cutting room floor somewhere lies footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .|
|negative|,|while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .|
|negative|,|there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid|
|negative|,|nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this|
|negative|,|here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets|
|negative|,|this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .|
|negative|,|the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that the actor actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .|
|negative|,|on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .|
|negative|,|it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .|
|negative|,|a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .|
|negative|,|as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .|
|negative|,|the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film is dudsville .|
|negative|,|our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender and i know this because i've seen that movie|
|negative|,|the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters|
|negative|,|the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .|
|negative|,|stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish|
|negative|,|somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as he experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .|
|negative|,|the action clichs just pile up .|
|negative|,|he tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .|
|negative|,|another useless recycling of a brutal mid 70s american sports movie .|
|negative|,|i didn't laugh . i didn't smile|
|negative|,|please , someone , stop him before he makes another film .|
|negative|,|most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved|
|negative|,|if you're just in the mood for a bad movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .|
|negative|,|curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .|
|negative|,|there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .|
|negative|,|the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .|
|negative|,|analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .|
|negative|,|with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout by which time it's impossible to care who wins .|
|negative|,|stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .|
|negative|,|the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced. it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition|
|negative|,|when he appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '|
|negative|,|an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .|
|negative|,|forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?|
|negative|,|though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .|
|negative|,|a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .|
|negative|,|a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .|
|negative|,|the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .|
|negative|,|the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end .|
|negative|,|the characters are never more than sketches, which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .|
|negative|,|this underdeveloped effort is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination|
|negative|,|isn't as sharp as the original despite some visual virtues , the movie just doesn't cut it .|
|negative|,|plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer and the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried .|
|negative|,|maybe he thought , "hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . "|
|negative|,|what you expect is just what you get, assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height .|
|negative|,|the biggest problem with his uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .|
|negative|,|so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along|
|negative|,|i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .|
|negative|,|earnest but heavy-handed .|
|negative|,|if his character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over|
|negative|,|too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .|
|negative|,|there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . That movie is a big time stinker .|
|negative|,|a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .|
|negative|,|takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .|
|negative|,|the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .|
|negative|,|even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .|
|negative|,|sitting through the last reel is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .|
|negative|,|confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .|
|negative|,|deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .|
|negative|,|with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .|
|negative|,|one can only assume that the jury who bestowed him with the screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off|
|negative|,|a movie as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing music and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .|
|negative|,|the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .|
|negative|,|skip the film and buy the soundtrack cd .|
|negative|,|feels like a cold old man going through the motions .|
|negative|,|dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?|
|negative|,|dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit|
|negative|,|there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of her prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .|
|negative|,|the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .|
|negative|,|completely awful iranian drama|
|negative|,|narratively , that movie is a mess .|
|negative|,|there's no point in the plot. It's just a bland hollywood romance .|
|negative|,|there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for him, but it's also one that feels clumsy and convoluted .|
|negative|,|it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .|
|negative|,|the movie is a mess from start to finish .|
|negative|,|the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .|
|negative|,|i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .|
|negative|,|the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichs from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times|
|negative|,|terminally brain dead production .|
|negative|,|some episodes work , some don't .|
|negative|,|beautifully filmed and well acted, but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .|
|negative|,|not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .|
|negative|,|wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .|
|negative|,|it's also curious to note that this film is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .|
|negative|,|there's nothing interesting whatsoever .|
|negative|,|none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .|
|negative|,|a processed comedy|
|negative|,|fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix .|
|negative|,|full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .|
|negative|,|the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .|
|negative|,|with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .|
|negative|,|if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .|
|negative|,|the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .|
|negative|,|a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .|
|negative|,|they are too immature and unappealing to care about .|
|negative|,|one lousy movie .|
|negative|,|plodding , peevish and gimmicky .|
|negative|,|the movie is shapeless and inconsequential, relying on the viewer to do most of the work .|
|negative|,|the direction has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .|
|negative|,|hypnotically dull .|
|negative|,|though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .|
|negative|,|it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else especially in a moral sense .|
|negative|,|confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .|
|negative|,|occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .|
|negative|,|journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .|
|negative|,|this movie doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .|
|negative|,|with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .|
|negative|,|director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .|
|negative|,|you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .|
|negative|,|it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor|
|negative|,|this film looks and feels tired .|
|negative|,|i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .|
|negative|,|one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .|
|negative|,|thoroughly awful .|
|negative|,|ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 .|
|negative|,|though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .|
|negative|,|just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .|
|negative|,|the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .|
|negative|,|truly terrible .|
|negative|,|a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .|
|negative|,|it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .|
|negative|,|fluffy and disposible .|
|negative|,|such a bad movie|
|negative|,|if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is .|
|negative|,|holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .|
|negative|,|the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .|
|negative|,|a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .|
|negative|,|what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .|
|negative|,|there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .|
|negative|,|such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .|
|negative|,|the players are clueless and the acting isn't much better .|
|negative|,|the whole affair is as predictable as can be .|
|negative|,|it feels more forced than usual .|
|negative|,|such a nonsensical story .|
|negative|,|a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .|
|negative|,|you'll come out feeling strangely unsatisfied|
|negative|,|the worst film of the year .|
|negative|,|the film can depress you about life itself .|
|negative|,|the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .|
|negative|,|an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .|
|negative|,|unfortunately , it's not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .|
|negative|,|glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .|
|negative|,|this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .|
|negative|,|a big fat pain .|
|negative|,|unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad|
|negative|,|an opportunity wasted .|
|negative|,|such a cheesy flick|
|negative|,|mild , meandering teen flick .|
|negative|,|though its atmosphere is intriguing, the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .|
|negative|,|though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before .|
|negative|,|although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league .|
|negative|,|astonishing isn't the word neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap|
|negative|,|his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .|
|negative|,|not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were i doubt it would be all that interesting .|
|negative|,|feels slight .|
|negative|,|the movie falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .|
|negative|,|this remake is the biggest disaster in a while|
|negative|,|silly , loud and goofy .|
|negative|,|the director has turned out nearly 2.5 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema|
|negative|,|the pool drowned me in boredom .|
|negative|,|it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .|
|negative|,|it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us|
|negative|,|bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .|
|negative|,|a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .|
|negative|,|the film lacks balance and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .|
|negative|,|there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .|
|negative|,|this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .|
|negative|,|he delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .|
|negative|,|given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .|
|negative|,|the script tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .|
|negative|,|a soulless , stupid sequel|
|negative|,|a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers .|
|negative|,|it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .|
|negative|,|cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace .|
|negative|,|an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .|
|negative|,|the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .|
|negative|,|the movie sets a new benchmark for lameness .|
|negative|,|it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .|
