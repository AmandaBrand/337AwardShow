|negative|,|if his character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over|
|negative|,|too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .|
|negative|,|there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . That movie is a big time stinker .|
|negative|,|a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .|
|negative|,|takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .|
|negative|,|the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers .|
|negative|,|even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .|
|negative|,|sitting through the last reel is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house .|
|negative|,|confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .|
|negative|,|deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .|
|negative|,|with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .|
|negative|,|one can only assume that the jury who bestowed him with the screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off|
|negative|,|a movie as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing music and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .|
|negative|,|the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .|
|negative|,|skip the film and buy the soundtrack cd .|
|negative|,|feels like a cold old man going through the motions .|
|negative|,|dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?|
|negative|,|dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit|
|negative|,|there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of her prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .|
|negative|,|the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .|
|negative|,|completely awful iranian drama|
|negative|,|narratively , that movie is a mess .|
|negative|,|there's no point in the plot. It's just a bland hollywood romance .|
|negative|,|there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for him, but it's also one that feels clumsy and convoluted .|
|negative|,|it's all tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it .|
|negative|,|the movie is a mess from start to finish .|
|negative|,|the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .|
|negative|,|i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .|
|negative|,|the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichs from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times|
|negative|,|terminally brain dead production .|
|negative|,|some episodes work , some don't .|
|negative|,|problematic in its narrative specifics .|
|negative|,|not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were .|
|negative|,|wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .|
|negative|,|it's also curious to note that this film is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .|
|negative|,|there's nothing interesting whatsoever .|
|negative|,|none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .|
|negative|,|a processed comedy|
|negative|,|fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix .|
|negative|,|full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .|
|negative|,|the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .|
|negative|,|with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .|
|negative|,|if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .|
|negative|,|the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing .|
|negative|,|a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .|
|negative|,|they are too immature and unappealing to care about .|
|negative|,|one lousy movie .|
|negative|,|plodding , peevish and gimmicky .|
|negative|,|the movie is shapeless and inconsequential, relying on the viewer to do most of the work .|
|negative|,|the direction has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .|
|negative|,|hypnotically dull .|
|negative|,|though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .|
|negative|,|it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else especially in a moral sense .|
|negative|,|confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .|
|negative|,|occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .|
|negative|,|journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .|
|negative|,|this movie doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .|
|negative|,|with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low .|
|negative|,|director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .|
|negative|,|you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring .|
|negative|,|it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor|
|negative|,|this film looks and feels tired .|
|negative|,|i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .|
|negative|,|one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .|
|negative|,|thoroughly awful .|
|negative|,|ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 .|
|negative|,|though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .|
|negative|,|just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .|
|negative|,|the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .|
|negative|,|truly terrible .|
|negative|,|a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .|
|negative|,|it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .|
|negative|,|fluffy and disposible .|
|negative|,|such a bad movie|
|negative|,|if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is .|
|negative|,|holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .|
|negative|,|the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .|
|negative|,|a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .|
|negative|,|what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .|
|negative|,|there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .|
|negative|,|such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .|
|negative|,|the players are clueless and the acting isn't much better .|
|negative|,|the whole affair is as predictable as can be .|
|negative|,|it feels more forced than usual .|
|negative|,|such a nonsensical story .|
|negative|,|a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .|
|negative|,|you'll come out feeling strangely unsatisfied|
|negative|,|the worst film of the year .|
|negative|,|the film can depress you about life itself .|
|negative|,|the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .|
|negative|,|an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .|
|negative|,|unfortunately , it's not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .|
|negative|,|glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .|
|negative|,|this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .|
|negative|,|a big fat pain .|
|negative|,|unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad|
|negative|,|an opportunity wasted .|
|negative|,|such a cheesy flick|
|negative|,|mild , meandering teen flick .|
|negative|,|though its atmosphere is intriguing, the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .|
|negative|,|though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before .|
|negative|,|although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league .|
|negative|,|astonishing isn't the word neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap|
|negative|,|his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .|
|negative|,|not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were i doubt it would be all that interesting .|
|negative|,|feels slight .|
|negative|,|the movie falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .|
|negative|,|this remake is the biggest disaster in a while|
|negative|,|silly , loud and goofy .|
|negative|,|the director has turned out nearly 2.5 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema|
|negative|,|the pool drowned me in boredom .|
|negative|,|it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .|
|negative|,|it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us|
|negative|,|bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .|
|negative|,|a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .|
|negative|,|the film lacks balance and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .|
|negative|,|there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .|
|negative|,|this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .|
|negative|,|he delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .|
|negative|,|given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is .|
|negative|,|the script tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot .|
|negative|,|a soulless , stupid sequel|
|negative|,|a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers .|
|negative|,|it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .|
|negative|,|cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace .|
|negative|,|an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense .|
|negative|,|the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .|
|negative|,|the movie sets a new benchmark for lameness .|
|negative|,|it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .|
|negative|,|the colors are so annoying|

|positive|,|cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days|
|positive|,|though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .|
|positive|,|like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series .|

|positive|,|a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors .|
|positive|,|this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever .|
|positive|,|just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .|

|positive|,|this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .|
|positive|,|at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .|
|positive|,|the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible !|
|positive|,|if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next .|
|positive|,|it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured .|

|positive|,|this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .|
|positive|,|an imaginative comedy/thriller .|
|positive|,|a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days .|
|positive|,|its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .|
|positive|,|director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .|

|positive|,|a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .|
|positive|,|the director of bourne directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations|
|positive|,|the tenderness of the piece is still intact .|

|positive|,|a roller-coaster ride of a movie|
|positive|,|i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory .|
|positive|,|chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .|
|positive|,|on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique .|
|positive|,|the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure|
|positive|,|if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that .|
|positive|,|a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe .|
|positive|,|the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema|

|positive|,|a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .|
|positive|,|a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .|

|positive|,|the movie succeeds by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism .|
|positive|,|far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . innocent and well-meaning .|
|positive|,|enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .|
|positive|,|here's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you .|
|positive|,|it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .|
|positive|,|must be seen to be believed .|

|positive|,|it is interesting and fun to see them on the bigger-than-life screen .|
|positive|,|the movie is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do .|
|positive|,|a rare , beautiful film .|
|positive|,|an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story .|
|positive|,|a thoughtful look at an incident that made headlines years ago .|
|positive|,|we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed .|
|positive|,|though this film can be , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .|
|positive|,|daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget .|
|positive|,|the result is something quite fresh and delightful .|
|positive|,|all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure .|
|positive|,|this is one of his best films .|
|positive|,|an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .|
|positive|,|i admired it , particularly that unexpected ending .|
|positive|,|the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .|
|positive|,|remarkably accessible and affecting .|
|positive|,|a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !|
|positive|,|he himself knew how to spin a tale and one can't help but think he'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art .|
|positive|,|the script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality|
|positive|,|the complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out .|
|positive|,|provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of the actor.|
|positive|,|windtalkers is gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .|
|positive|,|presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .|
|positive|,|just what makes us happy , anyway ?|
|positive|,|a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty .|
|positive|,|one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .|
|positive|,|this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .|
|positive|,|the director has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .|
|positive|,|it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .|
|positive|,|the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .|
|positive|,|a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship .|
|positive|,|understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .|
|positive|,|the movie is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb|
|positive|,|an impressive debut for first-time writer-director, especially considering his background is in music video .|
|positive|,|all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .|
|positive|,|it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be .|
|positive|,|this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it's hard to know what to praise first .|
|positive|,|he holds true to his own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .|
|positive|,|thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda .|
|positive|,|if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then this movie offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .|
|positive|,|the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime .|
|positive|,|there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty .|
|positive|,|a wonderful character-based comedy .|
|positive|,|it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count .|
|positive|,|an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .|
|positive|,|the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .|
|positive|,|it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie|
|positive|,|it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia .|
|positive|,|who knows what exactly he is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you .|
|positive|,|the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .|
|positive|,|the principals in this cast are all fine , but those two are standouts .|
|positive|,|it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .|
|positive|,|if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the movie will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .|
|positive|,|intriguing and beautiful film|
|positive|,|the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain .|
|positive|,|a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear .|
|positive|,|the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .|
|positive|,|this clever caper movie has twists worthy of him and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .|
|positive|,|it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .|
|positive|,|even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .|
|positive|,|i don't know precisely what to make of him full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it .|
|positive|,|nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .|
|positive|,|you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable .|
|positive|,|an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail .|
|positive|,|high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .|
|positive|,|it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .|
|positive|,|he is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are .|
|positive|,|they offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love .|
|positive|,|this bold and lyrical first feature expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .|
